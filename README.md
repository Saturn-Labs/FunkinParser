# Developer tool for those who want to parse Friday Night Funkin' charts on C#
This tool is not affiliated with Friday Night Funkin' or any of its developers.<br>
Support for legacy (1.0.0) charts<br>
Support for new (2.0.0) charts<br>
Support for new (2.0.0 > 2.2.4) metadata<br>
Support for conversion of legacy charts to new chart and metadata pair<br>
Crappy code, but it should work as expected :P<br>
No Documentation, but this is a developer tool and the code is pretty self-explanatory<br>
The class 'Converter' is the class to deserialize and serialize metadata and charts<br>
